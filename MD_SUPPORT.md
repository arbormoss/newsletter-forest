# Markdown Support

As of now there is no unified Markdown standard, and some Md features will break for specific targets.
Twitter has almost no styling because I don't want to deal with rich text.
Discord and MailChimp should support most basic Md features, but are not unified yet or fully tested.

## Discord

- [x] [Discord Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/discord/)
- [x] Images
  - [ ] Inline images
- [x] Todo bullets

## Twitter

Twitter's styling support is very limited. I do not expect to fully support Markdown on it in the future.

- [x] Todo bullets
- [ ] Bold (rich text)
- [ ] Italics (rich text)

## MailChimp

- [X] Bold
- [X] Italics
- [X] Bullets

  - [ ] Code blocks
